          <li>Donating blood is a safe process. A sterile needle is used only once for each donor and then discarded.</li>
          <li>Blood donation is a simple four-step process: registration, medical history and mini-physical, donation and refreshments.</li>
          <li>Every blood donor is given a mini physical, checking the donor's temperature, blood pressure, pulse and hemoglobin to ensure it is safe for the donor to give blood.</li>
          <li>The actual blood donation typically takes less than 15 minutes.</li>
          <li>The average adult has about 10 units of blood in his body. Roughly 1 unit is given during a duration.</li>
          <li>All donated blood is tested for HIV, hepatitis B and C, syphilis and other infectious diseases before it can be transfused to patients.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>Blood makes up about 7 percent of your body weight.</li>
          <li>There are four types of transfusable products that can be derived from blood: red cells, platelets, plasma and cryoprecipitate. Typically, two or three of these are produced from a unit of donated whole blood - hence each donation can help save up to three lives.</li>
          <li>Donors can give either whole blood or specific blood components only. The process of donating specific blood components - red cells, plasma or platelets - is called apheresis.</li>
          <li>One transfusion dose of platelets can be obtained through one apheresis donation of platelets or by combining the platelets derived from five whole blood donations.</li>
          <li>Donated platelets must be used within five days of collection.</li>
          <li>Healthy bone marrow makes a constant supply of red cells, plasma and platelets. The body will replenish the elements given during a blood donation - some in a matter of hours and others in a matter of days.</li>

          <li>The number one reason for donors to give blood is because they like to help others.</li>
          <li>Two most common reasons cited by people who don't give blood are: "Never thought about it" and "I don't like needles."</li>
          <li>One donation can help save the lives up to 3 people</li>
          <li>If you began donating blood at age 18 and donated every 90 days until you reached 60 you would have donated 30 gallons of blood, potentially helping save more than<strong>500 lives</strong></li>
          <li>O- type blood is needed in emergencies before the patient's blood type is known and with newborns who need blood.</li>
          <li>35% of people have O type blood.(positive or negative)</li>
          <li>0.4% of people have AB- type blood. AB- type blood donors are universal donors of plasma, which is often used in emergencies, for newborns and for patients requiring massive transfusions.</li>
          <br>
          <p>There are 4 main blood types: <strong>A, B, AB and O</strong></p>
